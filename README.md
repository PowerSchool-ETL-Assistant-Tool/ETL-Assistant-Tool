- **Natural Language Explanations**: Convert complex code into simple descriptions
- **Transformation Flow**: Visual representation of data processing steps
- **Step-by-step Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of each processing operation

### üìÅ File Analysis
- **Multiple Format Support**: CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), and schema files
- **Schema Detection**: Automatic data type inference and column analysis
- **Column Mapping**: Intelligent suggestions for source-to-target mappings
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Comprehensive quality scoring and recommendations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional installations required - runs entirely in the browser

### Installation
1. Download or clone the project files
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Start analyzing your ETL data!

### Usage

#### 1. Signatures Analysis
- Navigate to the "Signatures" tab
- View real-time metrics of your analyzed files
- Explore data type and quality distributions through interactive charts
- Review signature history for pattern identification

#### 2. Code Analysis
- Go to the "Code Overview" tab
- Paste your ETL code (SQL, Python, JavaScript) into the text area
- Click "Analyze Code" to get:
  - Plain language explanation of the code
  - Step-by-step processing breakdown
  - Visual transformation flow diagram

#### 3. File Analysis
- Switch to the "File Analysis" tab
- Upload files by:
  - Dragging and dropping files onto the upload area
  - Clicking "Choose Files" to select from your computer
- Explore the analysis results across four tabs:
  - **Schema**: Column details, data types, and statistics
  - **Column Mapping**: Suggested mappings with confidence scores
  - **Data Quality**: Quality metrics and improvement recommendations
  - **Data Preview**: Sample data rows for verification

## Supported File Formats

- **CSV**: Comma-separated values
- **Excel**: .xlsx and .xls formats
- **JSON**: Schema definitions (planned)
- **SQL**: DDL statements (planned)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Libraries**:
  - Chart.js for data visualizations
  - Papa Parse for CSV processing
  - SheetJS for Excel file handling
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for data persistence

## Sample Data

The project includes `sample-data.csv` for testing purposes. This file contains employee data with the following columns:
- ID (integer)
- Name (string)
- Email (string)
- Department (string)
- Salary (numeric)
- Hire Date (date)
- Status (string)

## Features in Detail

### Schema Analysis
- Automatic data type detection (string, integer, float, date, boolean)
- Column statistics (unique values, null counts, percentages)
- Sample value extraction for validation
- Structural pattern recognition

### Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: Percentage of non-empty cells
- **Uniqueness**: Duplicate detection and scoring
- **Overall Score**: Composite quality metric
- **Recommendations**: Actionable improvement suggestions

### Column Mapping Intelligence
- Pattern-based mapping suggestions
- Confidence scoring for each mapping
- Common field type recognition (ID, email, date, etc.)
- Editable mapping configurations

### Code Understanding
- Multi-language code parsing
- Business logic extraction
- Data flow visualization
- Plain language summaries

## Browser Compatibility
