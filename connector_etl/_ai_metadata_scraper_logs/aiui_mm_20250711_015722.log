***** The scraper/validator detected 1 SchoolYear wildcard(s) that need to be updated in config.js metadata based on the current date.  July 1st is used as the start of new school year. 
..... example: if current date is between July 1st, 2021 and June 30th, 2022, then the app uses 2021-2022 as the current school year
.....          all wild-carded SCHOOL_YEAR lists are checked to ensure they have this school year
.....          for example, this would cause '["2020-2021", "*"]' to be automatically updated to become '["2020-2021", "2021-2022", "*"]'
..... We require a developer to review these changes and to check them into Source Control before being allowed to proceed with updating our live systems.
..... To accomplish this automatic write-back, please run the _validateAllConnectorsWithSchoolYearWriteBack gradle task in Assessment_ETL
.....   and then check the changes back into Git before proceeding.
